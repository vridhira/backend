/**
 * Razorpay Event Queue — Module Loader
 *
 * Starts the BullMQ Worker that processes Razorpay webhook payloads.
 * This loader runs once during Medusa server startup, AFTER all modules have been
 * registered, so `container` has access to all Medusa services.
 *
 * The Worker uses a dedicated IORedis connection (maxRetriesPerRequest: null is
 * required for Workers that issue blocking Redis commands).
 *
 * BullMQ retry policy (from queue.ts defaultJobOptions):
 *   3 attempts, exponential backoff starting at 5s → 5s, 25s, 125s
 *   Failed jobs are kept in the "failed" set for up to 500 entries.
